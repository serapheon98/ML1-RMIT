This repository contains a comprehensive dataset on rental house prices across various locations in India, focusing on the cities of Delhi and Mumbai. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes detailed information such as house type, size, location, price, amenities, and more.

Dataset Details:
Source: Kaggle
Cities: Delhi and Mumbai
Variables: 16 descriptive variables
Data Size: Around 10,000 units
Purpose:
The primary goal of this project is to preprocess the dataset to prepare it for further predictive modeling. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Files:

dataset.csv: The original dataset file sourced from Kaggle.

preprocessed_dataset.csv: The preprocessed dataset ready for predictive modeling.

README.md: Provides an overview of the project, dataset details, and instructions for preprocessing.

Preprocessing Steps:

Data Cleaning: Removing or correcting any inconsistencies, errors, or outliers in the dataset.

Handling Missing Values: Imputing or removing missing values in the dataset.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for modeling.

Scaling Numerical Features: Scaling numerical features to bring them to a similar scale, if necessary.
